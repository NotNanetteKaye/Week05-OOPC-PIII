### PROJECTS IN THIS GIT:
## ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR, LIZARD, SPOCK (RPSLS)
"For this project, you will be building a console version of the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game! RPSLS is a great way to get more familiar with key Object-Oriented Programming concepts, like classes/objects, properties, methods, and inheritance.  This project will require thinking critically about where inheritance makes the most sense, and writing the logic of the game in such a way that any kind of player can play the game with the same results, and minimal modification of the code. Bear in mind your SOLID principles and keep it simple!"
